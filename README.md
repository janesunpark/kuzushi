# Kuzushi

Kuzushi is an exploratory, observational project documenting learning behaviors,
problem-solving strategies, and instructional design patterns in small-group and
one-on-one enrichment settings.

This repository contains anonymized, public-facing synthesis notes and
pedagogical observations intended for instructional design, reflection,
and future analysis.

Private data, identifying information, and placement decisions are maintained
separately and are not included here.

Initial structure and documentation in progress.o
